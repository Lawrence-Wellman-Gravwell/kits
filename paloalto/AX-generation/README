This directory contains tools to generate autoextractors for Palo Alto log types.

Running `makeax.sh` will create a single file, `palo.ax`, which contains all the extractor definitions.

The .txt files contain field names (e.g. "Source Address") as described in the topics under https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions.html

Those field names are converted to appropriate short names via the lookup table maintained in the `map` file.
