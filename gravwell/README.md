# Gravwell Internal Logging Kit

The Gravwell kit contains an overview dashboard and some investigative dashboards for easily viewing internal Gravwell component activity.

This kit is intended as a means to easily interact with the Gravwell internal logs and also provides an alert automation to detect when previously known ingesters fall offline.

This kit is typically version locked to a Gravwell distribution so that it can rapidly take advantage of new features and components, be sure to upgrade the kit when you upgrade you installation.
