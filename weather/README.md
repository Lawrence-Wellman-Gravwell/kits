# Weather Kit

This kit will gather current weather conditions for a list of locations, which can be viewed using the included dashboard.

You'll need an OpenWeatherMap API key (see [this guide](https://openweathermap.org/guide) to get a key).

The weather kit is licensed under the BSD 2-Clause license and the contents are available on [Github](https://github.com/gravwell/kits/tree/main/weather).
