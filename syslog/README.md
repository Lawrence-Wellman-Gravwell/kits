# Gravwell Syslog Kit

The Syslog kit contains an overview dashboard and some investigative dashboards for easily viewing syslog activity.

This kit is intended as a "getting started with syslog". It does not attempt to analyze any of the content in the actual syslog Message as the author does not know what syslog you are collecting.

Look for syslog derivative kits (e.g. sshd, dnsmasq) in the future!.
