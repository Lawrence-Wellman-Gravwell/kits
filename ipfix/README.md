# IPFIX Kit

This kit provides ready-to-roll dashboards, queries, templates, playbooks, and actionables for working with IPFIX data.

The IPFIX kit depends on the [Gravwell Netflow Ingester](https://docs.gravwell.io/docs/#!ingesters/ingesters.md#Netflow_Ingester) and makes heavy use of the [ipfix](https://docs.gravwell.io/docs/#!search/ipfix/ipfix.md) search module.
